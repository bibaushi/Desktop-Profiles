# Desktop Profiles &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mamiksik/CabinetProX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mamiksik/CabinetProX)
The main objective of this app is to make transitions between different work environments easier. As a user, you can predefine any number of profiles which stores data about system settings such as dark mode, accent colour, night shift but also apps internal states and window arrangments.

## Demo

Profiles save the layout of applications windows and the internal state of individual windows.
